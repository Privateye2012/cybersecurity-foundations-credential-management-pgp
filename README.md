# Cybersecurity Foundations – Credential Management & PGP

## Overview
This repository documents a practical cybersecurity exercise focused on secure credential management and basic cryptography.  
The work was developed in the context of the **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** course and aims to demonstrate hands-on practices related to password management, encryption, and operational security.

All sensitive information has been **sanitized**. The repository contains **examples only**, not real credentials or private keys.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the importance of secure credential management
- Apply best practices for password storage
- Use basic cryptographic tools to protect sensitive information
- Practice operational security (OPSEC) principles

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **KeePass** – secure password manager
- **PGP (Public Key Cryptography)** – creation and management of public keys
- **7-Zip** – file compression and encryption
- **Text files** – controlled examples for demonstration purposes

## Work Performed

### Credential Management
- Created a secure password database using KeePass
- Generated an emergency sheet containing recovery information
- Applied encryption and compression to protect sensitive files
- Organized credential-related information following security best practices

### PGP Key Management
- Generated a PGP key pair for secure communication
- Exported and managed public keys (`.asc` format)
- Maintained separation between public information and private/sensitive data

### Operational Security
- Avoided exposure of real credentials
- Used example files to demonstrate workflows
- Applied the principle of least disclosure
